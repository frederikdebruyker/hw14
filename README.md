JavaScript and DOM Manipulation
## Multi filter
Filter was set for all fields with onkeyup event for highter useability. 
Technically a single filter was used which should enable the functionality to be used for any table one wants to display.
## Layout
Bootstrap used throughout.

SVG image was incorporated in line with the starter html.

Cartoon was added to check out bootstrap format next to table.

Pacman was added for animation and interest only.
